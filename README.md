# QuestMasters
Welcome to the Enhanced TTRPG Dungeon Master Companion! Our project's goal is to:

- Create dynamic game worlds and NPCs.
- Deliver interactive and adaptive storytelling.
- Generate quests and combat encounters.
- Provide visual aids, rules assistance, and player progression tracking.
  
It's designed to enhance the TTRPG experience for both players and DMs. Join us in shaping the future of this project at the intersection of technology and tabletop role-playing games.

This has been an extremely lengthy and difficult project, and I would not have been able to do any of it without the help of multiple other Github users who have graciously shared their
own codes and advice to make this work. While this is still only the First Version of the concept, its become clear that it is possible and I look forward to working on it more in the future!
